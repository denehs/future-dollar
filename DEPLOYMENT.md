## üîç Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:
- [ ] All links work correctly
- [ ] Application works on different screen sizes
- [ ] JavaScript functions properly
- [ ] All input validation works
- [ ] Error handling is in place
- [ ] Performance is optimized

## üõ† Build Optimization (Optional)

For production deployment, you might want to:

### Minify JavaScript:
- Use tools like UglifyJS or Terser
- Reduces file size for faster loading

### Optimize Images:
- Compress any images you might add later
- Use appropriate formats (WebP, AVIF)

### Add Caching Headers:
Configure your hosting platform to set appropriate cache headers for static assets.

## üîí Security Considerations

Since this is a client-side application:
- No sensitive data processing
- No backend required
- HTTPS automatically provided by most platforms
- No database or user data storage

## üìä Analytics (Optional)

To track usage, you can add:
- Google Analytics
- Plausible Analytics
- Simple Analytics

Add the tracking code to the `<head>` section of `index.html`.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **404 Error**: Check that `index.html` is in the root directory
2. **JavaScript not working**: Ensure `script.js` path is correct
3. **Styling issues**: Verify Tailwind CSS CDN link is working
4. **CORS errors**: Use a proper web server, not file:// protocol

### Testing Your Deployment:
1. Test on different devices and browsers
2. Check all calculations work correctly
3. Verify responsive design
4. Test the advanced assumptions toggle
5. Validate asset allocation error handling

## üìû Support

If you encounter deployment issues:
1. Check the hosting platform's documentation
2. Verify all files are properly uploaded
3. Test locally first to isolate issues
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
