## 📊 Understanding Your Results

### Nominal Future Value
The raw dollar amount your investment could grow to, not accounting for inflation. This shows the absolute growth potential.

### Real Future Value
What that future amount would be worth in today's purchasing power, after accounting for inflation. This shows the true value increase.

### Investment Summary
- **Weighted Average Annual Return**: Based on your asset allocation and assumed returns
- **Time Horizon**: Number of years from now to your target year
- **Inflation Assumption**: The annual inflation rate used in calculations

## 🧮 Calculation Method

The application uses standard financial formulas:

### Weighted Average Return
```
Weighted_Return = (Stocks_% × Stock_Return) + (Bonds_% × Bond_Return) + (Cash_% × Cash_Return)
```

### Nominal Future Value
```
Future_Value_Nominal = Spending_Amount × (1 + Weighted_Return/100)^Years
```

### Real Future Value (Inflation-Adjusted)
```
Future_Value_Real = Spending_Amount × ((1 + Weighted_Return/100) / (1 + Inflation_Rate/100))^Years
```
